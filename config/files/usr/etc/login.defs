# Currently ERASECHAR, KILLCHAR and ULIMIT are not supported

# Default initial "umask" value used by login(1) on non-PAM enabled systems.
# Default "umask" value for pam_umask(8) on PAM enabled systems.
# UMASK is also used by useradd(8) and newusers(8) to set the mode for new
# home directories if HOME_MODE is not set.
# 022 is the default value, but 027, or even 077, could be considered
# for increased privacy. There is no One True Answer here: each sysadmin
# must make up their mind.
UMASK		027

# HOME_MODE is used by useradd(8) and newusers(8) to set the mode for new
# home directories.
# If HOME_MODE is not set, the value of UMASK is used to create the mode.

# Password aging controls:

#	PASS_MAX_DAYS	Maximum number of days a password may be used.
#	PASS_MIN_DAYS	Minimum number of days allowed between password changes.

#	PASS_WARN_AGE	Number of days warning given before a password expires.

# If set to MD5, MD5-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to SHA256, SHA256-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to SHA512, SHA512-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to BCRYPT, BCRYPT-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to YESCRYPT, YESCRYPT-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to DES, DES-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password (default)
#
ENCRYPT_METHOD YESCRYPT

#
# Only works if ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to YESCRYPT.
#
# Define the YESCRYPT cost factor.
# With a higher cost factor, it is more difficult to brute-force the password.
# However, more CPU time and more memory will be needed to authenticate users
# if this value is increased.
#
# If not specified, a cost factor of 5 will be used.
# The value must be within the 1-11 range.

YESCRYPT_COST_FACTOR 11
